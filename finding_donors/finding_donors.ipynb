    "## Getting Started\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, you will employ several supervised algorithms of your choice to accurately model individuals' income using data collected from the 1994 U.S. Census. You will then choose the best candidate algorithm from preliminary results and further optimize this algorithm to best model the data. Your goal with this implementation is to construct a model that accurately predicts whether an individual makes more than $50,000. This sort of task can arise in a non-profit setting, where organizations survive on donations.  Understanding an individual's income can help a non-profit better understand how large of a donation to request, or whether or not they should reach out to begin with.  While it can be difficult to determine an individual's general income bracket directly from public sources, we can (as we will see) infer this value from other publically available features. \n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset for this project originates from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Census+Income). The datset was donated by Ron Kohavi and Barry Becker, after being published in the article _\"Scaling Up the Accuracy of Naive-Bayes Classifiers: A Decision-Tree Hybrid\"_. You can find the article by Ron Kohavi [online](https://www.aaai.org/Papers/KDD/1996/KDD96-033.pdf). The data we investigate here consists of small changes to the original dataset, such as removing the `'fnlwgt'` feature and records with missing or ill-formatted entries."

    "For highly-skewed feature distributions such as `'capital-gain'` and `'capital-loss'`, it is common practice to apply a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_transformation_(statistics)\">logarithmic transformation</a> on the data so that the very large and very small values do not negatively affect the performance of a learning algorithm. Using a logarithmic transformation significantly reduces the range of values caused by outliers. Care must be taken when applying this transformation however: The logarithm of `0` is undefined, so we must translate the values by a small amount above `0` to apply the the logarithm successfully.\n",

    "In addition to performing transformations on features that are highly skewed, it is often good practice to perform some type of scaling on numerical features. Applying a scaling to the data does not change the shape of each feature's distribution (such as `'capital-gain'` or `'capital-loss'` above); however, normalization ensures that each feature is treated equally when applying supervised learners. Note that once scaling is applied, observing the data in its raw form will no longer have the same original meaning, as exampled below.\n",

    "\n",
    "From the table in **Exploring the Data** above, we can see there are several features for each record that are non-numeric. Typically, learning algorithms expect input to be numeric, which requires that non-numeric features (called *categorical variables*) be converted. One popular way to convert categorical variables is by using the **one-hot encoding** scheme. One-hot encoding creates a _\"dummy\"_ variable for each possible category of each non-numeric feature. For example, assume `someFeature` has three possible entries: `A`, `B`, or `C`. We then encode this feature into `someFeature_A`, `someFeature_B` and `someFeature_C`.\n",

    "| 2 |  A  |  | 1 | 0 | 0 |\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, as with the non-numeric features, we need to convert the non-numeric target label, `'income'` to numerical values for the learning algorithm to work. Since there are only two possible categories for this label (\"<=50K\" and \">50K\"), we can avoid using one-hot encoding and simply encode these two categories as `0` and `1`, respectively. In code cell below, you will need to implement the following:\n",
    " - Use [`pandas.get_dummies()`](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.get_dummies.html?highlight=get_dummies#pandas.get_dummies) to perform one-hot encoding on the `'features_log_minmax_transform'` data.\n",

It would seem that using **accuracy** as a metric for evaluating a particular model's performace would be appropriate. Additionally, identifying someone that *does not* make more than \\$50,000 as someone who does would be detrimental to *CharityML*, since they are looking to find individuals willing to donate. Therefore, a model's ability to precisely predict those that make more than \\$50,000 is *more important* than the model's ability to **recall** those individuals. We can use **F-beta score** as a metric that considers both precision and recall:\n",

    "Looking at the distribution of classes (those who make at most \\$50,000, and those who make more), it's clear most individuals do not make more than \\$50,000. This can greatly affect **accuracy**, since we could simply say *\"this person does not make more than \\$50,000\"* and generally be right, without ever looking at the data! Making such a statement would be called **naive**, since we have not considered any information to substantiate the claim. It is always important to consider the *naive prediction* for your data, to help establish a benchmark for whether a model is performing well. That been said, using that prediction would be pointless: If we predicted all people made less than \\$50,000, *CharityML* would identify no one as donors. \n",

    "\n",
    "** Accuracy ** measures how often the classifier makes the correct prediction. It’s the ratio of the number of correct predictions to the total number of predictions (the number of test data points).\n",
    "\n",
    "** Precision ** tells us what proportion of messages we classified as spam, actually were spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all positives(all words classified as spam, irrespective of whether that was the correct classificatio), in other words it is the ratio of\n",

    "\n",
    "** Recall(sensitivity)** tells us what proportion of messages that actually were spam were classified by us as spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all the words that were actually spam, in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Negatives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "For classification problems that are skewed in their classification distributions like in our case, for example if we had a 100 text messages and only 2 were spam and the rest 98 weren't, accuracy by itself is not a very good metric. We could classify 90 messages as not spam(including the 2 that were spam but we classify them as not spam, hence they would be false negatives) and 10 as spam(all 10 false positives) and still get a reasonably good accuracy score. For such cases, precision and recall come in very handy. These two metrics can be combined to get the F1 score, which is weighted average(harmonic mean) of the precision and recall scores. This score can range from 0 to 1, with 1 being the best possible F1 score(we take the harmonic mean as we are dealing with ratios)."

    "**Answer:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **AdaBoost:**\n",
    "    * Application in customer churn prediction (https://www.cs.rit.edu/~rlaz/PatternRecognition/slides/churn_adaboost.pdf). Here the system makes predictions about customers who have the tenedecy to cease the business with a company. Being aware of those potential leaving customers is very important for many companies in order to react early. \n",
    "    * **Strengths:** AdaBoost belongs to the ensemble algorithm where many weak learners are brought together to build a stronger model.The ensemble models can normaly better handle imbalanced data than some of the other models. AdaBoost is not so prone to overfitting. \n",
    "    * **Weaknesses:** AdaBoost is sensitive to noise data. Outliners can hightly disturb the results of the model. \n",
    "    * AdaBoost was choosen as a candidate because it is a strong ensemble/boosting model (its normaly stronger than single weak learners). The hope was that ensemble algorithm are better with imbalanced data.\n",
    "    \n",
    " \n",
    "2. **GradientBoosting**\n",
    "    * The Model is used for forecasting the performance efficiency of promotions (see: https://www.researchgate.net/publication/346111251_Gradient_Boosting_Application_in_Forecasting_of_Performance_Indicators_Values_for_Measuring_the_Efficiency_of_Promotions_in_FMCG_Retail). Here promotions performance indicators are used to measure there performance effect. \n",
    "    * **Strengths:** GradientBoosting also belongs to the ensemble algorithm where many weak learners are brought together to build a stronger model. Here also the hope was that tree-based ensemble algorithm can handle imbalanced data better then other algorithm. GradientBoosting often provides a good predictive accuracy and has a lot of flexibility with its hyperparameters. It can handle missing data. \n",
    "    * **Weaknesses:** Can overemphasize outliers and overfitting. The model can be computational expencive. The results are less interpretable.\n",
    "    * GradientBoosting was also choosen because it is another strong ensemble/boosting model. Also here the hope was that tree-based ensemble methodes are better with imbalanced data. Another reason was that GradientBoosting is known for delivering a good accuracy score (compared to other models).\n",
    "    \n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Super Vector Machine**\n",
    "    * Support Vector Machines are used in face detection systems (see here: https://www.datasciencecentral.com/real-life-applications-of-support-vector-machines/). In those systems it is necessarry to classify parts of the image as face or not face.\n",
    "    * **Strengths:** SVMs are good if there are no or less information about the data. It works well with unstructured or semi structured data (like text and images). With the appropriate kernel function nearly every problem can be solved. Less risk of overfitting\n",
    "    * **Weaknesses:** It is difficult to choose a good kernel function. Long training time for large data-sets. \n",
    "    * SuperVectorMachine was choosen because it has a wide spectrum of applications and the chance of overfitting is small. Maybe the trainings-time could be long.\n",

    "   For the current problem of finding donors, I've choosen the Gradient Boosting Estimator in order to predict appropriate donors. The Gradient Boosting Model is a so called ensembel method. This means a lot of (weak) learners build a really strong learner. For that the boosting method will be used. This means every learner (model) is trained to reduce the error of the last outcome. In order to reduce the error the gradient descent approach is used."

Maybe that feature is more meaningful than education_level. And age doesn't seem so importand than I thought.\n",

    "How does a model perform if we only use a subset of all the available features in the data? With less features required to train, the expectation is that training and prediction time is much lower — at the cost of performance metrics. From the visualization above, we see that the top five most important features contribute more than half of the importance of **all** features present in the data. This hints that we can attempt to *reduce the feature space* and simplify the information required for the model to learn. The code cell below will use the same optimized model you found earlier, and train it on the same training set *with only the top five important features*. "
